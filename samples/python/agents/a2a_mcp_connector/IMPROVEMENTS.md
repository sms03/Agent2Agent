# A2A-MCP Connector: Implementation Improvements

## Overview of Changes

We've made significant architectural improvements to the A2A-MCP Connector to better align with best practices from the official MCP documentation and Google's ADK MCPToolset approach.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Resource Management with AsyncExitStack

- **MCPConnectionManager** now uses a shared `AsyncExitStack` for managing all server connections
- **MCPServerConnection** properly manages async resources with context managers
- Proper cleanup is ensured through the exit stack approach

### 2. Improved Connection Lifecycle Management

- Connections are properly established using async context managers
- Cleanup is handled automatically through the exit stack
- The implementation now correctly closes all connections on shutdown

### 3. Enhanced Transport Support

- Better support for different transport mechanisms (JSON-RPC, SSE, STDIO)
- Added environment variable support for STDIO transport
- Improved header handling for HTTP-based transports

### 4. Better MCP Client Integration

- Support for both newer (v1.2.0+) and older MCP client APIs
- The `_execute_tool_with_session` method handles both APIs gracefully
- Added direct tool listing for JSON-RPC transport without MCP client libraries

### 5. Robust Error Handling

- Improved error handling for connection failures
- Better logging of errors
- Consistent error response format

### 6. Code Organization and Documentation

- Added comprehensive documentation
- Improved code structure
- Added unit tests

## Usage Example

```python
# Create a connection manager
manager = MCPConnectionManager()

# Register an MCP server
result = await manager.register_server(
    server_id="weather-server",
    server_url="http://localhost:8000",
    server_description="Weather forecast tools",
    transport_type="jsonrpc"
)

# List available tools
tools = manager.list_tools()

# Execute a tool
forecast = await manager.execute_tool(
    tool_id="get-forecast",
    input_data={"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194}
)

# Properly clean up connections
await manager.close_all_connections()
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for authentication in different transport types
2. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
3. Add support for streaming responses from MCP tools
4. Consider implementing a connection pool for high-throughput scenarios
